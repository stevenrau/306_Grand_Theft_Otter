|/////////////////////////// TO DO \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\|
|-------------------------------------------------------------|

Bugs:
-> Pearl shoots out of water
-> Fix the boundary colliders + seawead walls (keep some seaweed for aesthetic puposes, make new walls)

Player Actions:
-> Dash
   - Water animation (rushes by)
   - Brief "power-up" delay
   - Speed boost
   - Player who gets hit drops pearl (if they have the pearl)
   - Player who gets hit is stunned for a brief period
   - Limit to dash frequency
   
-> Throw
-> Breathing input triggers
   - Threshold for # keypresses/time (dependant on update interval)
   - If player breathes underwater:
     (a)Controls disabled
	 (b)Animation plays
	 (c)Float to the top
	 (d)Player can now breathe freely
	 (e)Player state is reset once they reach the surface
   - Surface will be defined as a trigger box collider
   - Beaver will have a game object attached to the mouth that will trigger when breathing is "allowed"
-> Virtual breath
   - On screen breath meter for each player (position is up for debate)
   - Breath decreases over time
   - Player goes to the breathing zone to gain breath

Audio:
-> Music
-> Player sounds
-> Interaction sounds (splash, throw, pearl hitting objects, etc.)

Menu:
-> View instructions
-> Breathing input option
-> Backstory (shown before playing)

Points/Scoring:
-> Create sprites for dam growth
-> Dam grows with points scored
-> Breathable area shrinks with growing dam
-> Modify scoring zone/behaviour
   - Change dam shape to shrink entrace.
   - Allow player to walk on land (on the scoring platform) via their dam entrance
   - The player will start on the "bridge"
   - The bridge will build towards a goal.
   - Once the bridge reaches the goal, otters will be able to grab it to win.
   - Prevent players from entering opposing dams

Aesthetics:
-> Obstacles
-> Change beaver to otter?? (low priority)
-> Pearl splashes out of water
-> Water animation around moving beaver
-> Make otters gangster
